# A Front-end Handbook for Beginners - Part 2: Basic Concepts
This is the second part of the Front-end Handbook for Beginners. In this part, we will discuss some basic concepts of the Front-end engineering.

Before diving into the code, there are some concepts to which you need to get familiar. These concepts are very important to draw a big picture in your head about what you will learn and what it will do.
## What is a web page?
Let's start with one of the most familiar things in your computer - a web browser. If you usually use computer, you should know about software. Everything you run on your computer are softwares, it's just a bunch of code written by some programmer on Earth. A web browser is also a program run on computer, so it's basically a software too, just like Photoshop, Microsoft Office, Age of Empires, Windows Defender, etc. But if they are all softwares so what are the differences? Are they all the same? No! What makes a web browser different from the others is that they display web pages. It is designed and programmed with the main purpose of understanding and displaying web pages.

Technically, a web page is a text file that carries information structured in a predefined format that a web browser can understand and display it. In simple words, a web page shows texts, images, videos, links, buttons in a browser so that people can see, read, listen and interact with it. When you are reading this article, everything inside the browser window are belonged to a web page, which is the URL in the search bar.

Web pages are very dynamic that a web deverloper can determine what information to be displayed, how it will be displayed and how user can interact with it. For example, as a web developer, you can choose your web page to display an article with title, content, author, images, videos, user comments, share buttons, related articles, etc. If you want create an e-commerce site, you can choose to display products' information such as name, price and description in cards on the page, with a dark and a white theme chosen by users. It's all of your choices (may depend on your client requirements).

To understand more about the detail of a web page, the next section will explain the main components that create a web page nowaday.

## Components of a web page
There are 3 components, correspond to 3 languages that make a complete, fully functional web page:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
These components, combine with others media resources like images, icons, videos, audios are basically all components of a web page. The detail of these 3 languages will be discussed on the following articles.

Until then, you can consider them as the followings:
Imagine a web page is a person, a human who is made of bones, flesh, organs, skin, blood, etc.
HTML is the skeleton of a web page. It shapes the structure of the web page and its contents so that other components can hardly change it.
The next component is CSS. It is the skin, the eyes, the hair, the ears, the nose, the mouth, and all components that define the look of a web page.
Finally, a person without actively functioning (moving, walking, running, thinking, speaking, touching, holding, etc.) is much like a statue than a living human. JavaScript is able to create functionalities for his/her hands, legs, head, eyes, so that they can work normally.
